# AI Voice Assistant üé§ü§ñ

A Python-based AI voice assistant that can play music, answer questions using Llama 3, and respond to voice commands. Perfect for beginners who want to explore AI and voice recognition technology!

## üåü Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Listen and respond to voice commands
- **Music Player**: Play songs from your music library with voice commands
- **AI Chat**: Get answers to questions using Llama 3 AI model
- **Text-to-Speech**: Hear responses spoken back to you
- **Wake Word Detection**: Activate with custom wake words
- **Music Database**: Manage your music collection easily

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your computer
2. **Git** installed (to download the project)
3. **Microphone** connected to your computer
4. **Speakers or headphones** for audio output
5. **Internet connection** (for speech recognition and AI responses)

### How to Check Your Python Version

Open your terminal/command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```

If you don't have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://python.org).

## üöÄ Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download the Project

1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to where you want to store the project:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/desired/location
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-voice-assistant.git
   ```
4. Enter the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ai-voice-assistant
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies separate from other Python projects.

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You'll know it's activated when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line.

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pvporcupine pyaudio speechrecognition requests gtts
```

**Note**: If you get an error installing `pyaudio`, you might need to install additional system dependencies:

**On macOS:**
```bash
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
```

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio portaudio19-dev
pip install pyaudio
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

### Step 4: Set Up Porcupine (Wake Word Detection)

1. Go to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
2. Create a free account
3. Get your Access Key
4. Open the file `bloom_music_voice_assistant.py`
5. Find the line that says `ACCESS_KEY = ""`
6. Replace the empty quotes with your access key:
   ```python
   ACCESS_KEY = "your_access_key_here"
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up Llama 3 (Optional - for AI responses)

If you want the AI chat feature:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) on your computer
2. Download the Llama 3 model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3
   ```
3. Start Ollama:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

## üéµ Adding Music to Your Assistant

### Step 1: Prepare Your Music Files

1. Create a folder called `Music` in your project directory
2. Add your MP3 files to this folder
3. Make sure the files are named clearly (e.g., "song_name.mp3")

### Step 2: Add Songs to the Database

Run the assistant and use voice commands like:
- "Add song [song name] to database"
- "Add [artist name] [song title] to database"

Or manually edit the `music_database.json` file:
```json
{
    "song_key": {
        "title": "Song Title",
        "artist": "Artist Name",
        "file_path": "Music/song_file.mp3"
    }
}
```

- Verify the model name in the code matches your installed model

### Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the error messages in your terminal
2. Make sure all prerequisites are installed
3. Verify your virtual environment is activated
4. Try running the basic voice assistant first: `python voice_assistant.py`
